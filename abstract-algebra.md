# Abstract Algebra

## Group

A group is defined by:

- Set of elements $x$
- An Operation $*$
- Closed under $*$ (Unclosed is like division where $5 / 3$ is not a natural)
- Identity $e$: $x * e = e * x$
- Inverses $x^{-1}$ exists: $\forall{x}. x * x^{-1} = e$
- Associativity $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$

It is almost like a `Monoid` in [[haskell]]
