[Hy](https://hylang.org/) is a dialect of Lisp that's embedded in Python.

I contributed the `list?` function to `hy.core` and wrote a few program with it:

- A toy compiler to generate [[glsl]] from hy expression: [hy2glsl](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/hy2glsl).
- Fractal animations: [livet-nediser](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/demo-render/blob/master/animations/livet-nediser.hy)
