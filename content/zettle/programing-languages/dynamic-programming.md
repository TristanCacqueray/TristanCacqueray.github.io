# Dynamic Programming

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#History),
the concept was introduced by Richard Bellman in 1950 as a way to disguise
a research in mathematics. The Secretary of Defense [at that time], â€¦ would turn red,
and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence.
