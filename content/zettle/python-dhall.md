[python-dhall](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/python-dhall) is a python binding for [[dhall]] using the [dhall-rust](https://github.com/Nadrieril/dhall-rust) implementation.

This was my first project in [[rust]], and the development continued in [dhall-python](https://github.com/s-zeng/dhall-python).
