# Strudel Shader (live)

My piano phase with #strudel :)
I missed a few transitions and I forgot to pan the patterns, but this is my first performance using this system and I hope you'll like it!
The code is in my animation-fractal branch and I would appreciate feedback to integrate this shader feature in strudel.
