# Zettelkasten

Zettlekasten is a smart note taking system. This section is a collection of notes that I like. Feel free to propose changes by clicking the `edit` button at the top of each page.

Notes are linked by using forward (with `[[zettel]]#`) and/or backward (`#[[zettle]]`) reference. For example, check [[ML|this page]]
