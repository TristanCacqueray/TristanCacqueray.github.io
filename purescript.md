[Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/) is a strongly-typed functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.

It can also compiled to [[python]] with [purescript-python](https://github.com/purescript-python/) or the [[BEAM]].

I am writting a baduk interface with purescript in [pure-gnugo](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/pure-gnugo).
