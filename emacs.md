# Emacs

Emacs is among the oldest [[free-software]] still under development.
It is programmable with <emacs-lisp>.

My configuration is mostly provided by [[devenv]] and customized in my [dot-files/emacs.el](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/dot-files/blob/master/emacs.el).

## Magit

A [[git]] Porcelain inside Emacs.
