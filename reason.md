[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems. It is an [[ocaml]] syntax that is similar to JSX. It compiles to javascript using the [[rescript]] compiler.

I wrote a blog post about the language: [Software Factory Resources in Reason](https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/software-factory-resources-in-reason.html)
